They set up shop in Palo Alto in a small rented office. For the newspaper publishing sector, the company created and sold an Internet city guide including maps, directions, and yellow pages. Musk claims that he couldn't afford an apartment before the company became popular, so he rented an office, slept on the couch, showered at the YMCA, and shared one computer with his brother.

The company was one of the first federally insured internet banks, with over 200,000 customers in its first months of existence. Musk's investors viewed him as inexperienced, and before the end of the year, he had been replaced by Bill Harris, the CEO of Intuit. To minimize competition, X.com merged with online bank Confinity the following year. Confinity, which was founded by Max Levchin and Peter Thiel, had its own money-transfer service, PayPal, which was more popular than X.com's.
